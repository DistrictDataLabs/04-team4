    <h1>Time Graph Visualization</h1>
    <h2>Minimum Viable Product:</h2>
    <p>
      Our project is to extend and augment existing graph visualizations to handle a temporal component.  
      Many representations of graphs, even interactive ones, generally depict a graph that is in a static state, where the edge details between nodes are not changing.  
      New tools are needed to visualize changes in a graph over time.  
      We will add an interactive component to graph representations that allows a user to shift time, e.g. by adjusting sliders, to view how a graph changes when the time period it describes is changed.  
      Our minimal viable product will be a force-directed graph, with terms as nodes, co-occurrence as edges, and sliders to adjust what time frame is depicted.  
      The user will be able to adjust the sliders to view co-occurrences within different time periods, setting a start and end time.  
      As the user adjusts the sliders, edges will appear and others will disappear, and the graph will adjust to the changing data.  
      Frequency of co-occurrence may be depicted either by width of an edge, or the force the edge applies to the nodes it connects.
    </p>
    <h2>Data:</h2>
    <p>
      The input data will be generated from the Baleen project, details TBD.  
      At a minimum, we expect the data to include terms, co-occurrences of terms within documents, and dates on which co-occurrence was observed.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges:</h2>
    <p>
      There are two primary challenges this data will present.  
      First, co-occurrences will come and go.  
      The more granular the time periods, the more unstable the graph becomes with changes to time.  
      Second, the anticipated scale of the graph is enormous.  
      Steps will have to be taken either to allow interactive pruning of the graph, or to allow users to zoom in on details of the graph.
    </p>
    <h2>Possible enhancements to MVP:</h2>
    <p>
      One proposal is to provide the user an additional slider, or set of sliders, to limit which terms are displayed by some appropriate characteristics.  
      For example, users may be afforded the ability to limit the graph to only those terms with a high average tf*idf value.  
      This would allow the user to see relationships between only the most descriptive terms.  
      Additionally/alternatively, users may be able to limit the graph to only nodes with a certain n-degree.  
      This would allow the user to see relationships between terms that co-occur with many other terms or with only a few other terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another possibility we hope to explore is the use of <a href="http://www.biofabric.org/">BioFabric</a>, or a similar graph representation, rather than a force-directed graph.  
      This would allow the user to interact with a more stable graph.  
      It may also help navigate the large scale.
