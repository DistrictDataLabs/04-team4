<h3>Goal</h3>
To provide a visualization of a graph that supports representations of large scale interactions and chages in the graph over time.  We plan to use interactive graphs that allow the user to adjust a start and end time for the representation and see the chages in the graph.

<h3>&quot;Goal&quot; Data</h3>
<p><a href="http://baleen-ingest.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about/">Baleen</a> is a tool for ingesting formal natural language data from the discourse of professional and amateur writers: e.g. bloggers and news outlets. Rather than performing web scraping, Baleen focuses on data ingestion through the use of RSS feeds. It performs as much raw data collection as it can, saving data into a Mongo document store.</p>
<p>As of April 19, 2016, the corpus ingested 373 feeds containing 180,342 posts in 13 categories.</p>

<h3>&quot;Toy&quot; Data</h3>
Les Miserables character interactions, 80 characters in 356 chapters:
<ul>
	<li><a href="jean-dat.txt">Data source 1: Les Miserables character by chapter</a></li>
	<li><a href="miserables0.json">Data source 2: Les Miserables character groups</a></li>
</ul>
Chapter designations are similar to dates and can be used to define a range.  Graphs will show interactions within defined ranges of chapters.


<h3>Graphs</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="lesmis.html">Force graph</a> with weighted edges</li>
	<li><a href="SuperQuickBioFabric.html">A super-quick BioFabric demo</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Components</h3>
<ul>
	<li>JQuery UI for user input of date ranges (or Part/Book/Chapter)</li>
	<li>d3.js for display of data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Refactor backend in JScript</li>
	<li>Add weight/width to edges in BioFabric</li>
	<li>Add sliders to take user input of start and end dates/chapters</li>
</ul>
